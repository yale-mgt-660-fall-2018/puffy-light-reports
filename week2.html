        <b><u>Narrative of the week</u></b>
    </p> 
        <p>
            This week we had our first sprint planning meeting where we set up a first subset of user stories in trello <a href="https://trello.com/b/aXuBsV6K/rsvpeasy">Trello link</a></p>
            During the sprint planning meeting we agreed on the: 
            <ol start="1" type="1">
                <li>
                    Acceptance criteria
                </li>
                    <ol start="1" type="a">
                        <li>
                            Pull request performed (ideally should be code merged and promoted to Heroku but we want to break the dependency between the code writer and the code merger)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Test running in local
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Code aligned with the specification
                        </li>
                    </ol>
            </ol>
            <ol start="2" type="1">        
                <li>
                    Usage of poker sizing and the usage of the user story of reference 1 point (which we decided to be the button to go to about page)
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol start="3" type="1">        
                <li>
                    Assignment of user stories for first sprint
                </li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            During this week we have also been able to deploy the software in Heroku <a href="https://rsvpeasy.herokuapp.com">RSVPeasy</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The team is experincing technical difficulties to get started but we have done some progress this week during the office hours. However, the progress has not allowed us yet to complete any full functionality so our user stories are all failed as per the acceptance criteria that we have imposed to ourselves
        </p>
