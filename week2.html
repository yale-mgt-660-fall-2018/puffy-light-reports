        <b><u>Narrative of the week</u></b>
    </p> 
        <p>
            This week we had our first sprint planning meeting where we set up a first subset of user stories in trello <a href="https://trello.com/b/aXuBsV6K/rsvpeasy">Trello link</a></p>
            During the sprint planning meeting we agreed on the: 
            <ol start="1" type="1">
                <li>
                    Acceptance criteria
                </li>
                    <ol start="1" type="a">
                        <li>
                            Pull request performed (ideally should be code merged and promoted to Heroku but we want to break the dependency between the code writer and the code merger)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Test running in local
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Code aligned with the specification
                        </li>
                    </ol>
            </ol>
            <ol start="2" type="1">        
                <li>
                    Usage of poker sizing and the usage of the user story of reference 1 point (which we decided to be the button to go to about page)
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol start="3" type="1">        
                <li>
                    Assignment of user stories for first sprint
                </li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            During this week we have also been able to deploy the software in Heroku <a href="https://rsvpeasy.herokuapp.com">RSVPeasy</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The team is experincing technical difficulties to get started but we have done some progress this week as indicated in "Sprint Completed Stories". Special thanks this week go out to Griffin, who helped us getting started.</p>
